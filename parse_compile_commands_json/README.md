# parse_compile_commands_json.py

## Overview

This script parses a given file `compile_commands.json` generated by CMake when the option `set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)` is set.

> A file `compile_commands.json` contains compilation commands per a C-file in a project.

This script will collect all compilation flags and divide them into four categories:

* defines - flags that start with -D
* options - flags that start with -W or -f
* includes - flags that start with -I
* unknown - other flags

> Please note flags -Ox -ggdb -x_EXPORTS are skipped and not printed.

# Use cases

This script can be useful in the following scenarios:

- Quickly get a list of flags on a new project;
- Find issues - redundant or duplicated flags;
- Verify changes - make sure only relevant expected flags are applied according the build type (DEBUG vs. RELEASE, x86 vs. ARM, etc.)
- Fine tuning IDE (like VsCode)

## Requirements

* python3
